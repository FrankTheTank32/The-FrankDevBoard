This respository includes the bill of materials (BOM), GRBR and DRL files for PCB manufacturing and specifications, as well as the entire project folder itself for importing into KiCAD.

The DevBoard is comprised of an RP2040 microcontroller, lights, 43 pins total, an IMU, and a nice silkscreen design. It resembles the shape of an "F" after the name frame, and has the meming frog, as that also starts with an "F". This development board is extremely useful if you're looking to have a highly functional (and highly energetic) microcontroller electronics maker experience.
